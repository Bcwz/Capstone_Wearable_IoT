# Capstone_Wearable_IoT

**Title**: Prevention of heat-related work injuries using real-time health monitoring and thermoregulated wearable IoT. 


**Deliverables**: A working demonstrable portal that shows the integration of at least one non-wearable and one wearable device that provide a data logging (configurable timer) to a back-end portal.

**Scope**: Include 2 groups of devices: 
1. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) with temperature and humidity as a baseline.
2. Personal Healthcare with any two of body temperature, heartbeat and BPM (Pulse) as a baseline.
These data collected should be presented as part of the data visualisation module in the back-end portal.

**Software**:
1. Python - Version 3.10.1

**Libraries used**
1. TBD

**Software Architecture Design**
- TBD
